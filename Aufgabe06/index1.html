            <h2>What is "That '70s Show"</h2>
            <article>"That '70s Show" was an American TV show. It first aired on August 23, 1998. It was on TV till May 2006. Although it's basically a 90s/00s show, it's placed in the 70s hence the title.</article>
            <article>It's about six teenagers in the 70s. Their names are: Eric Forman, Michael Kelso, Steven Hyde, Jacky Burkhardt, Donna Pinciotti and Fez (that's not actually his real name. It just stands for "Foreign exchange student")</article>
            <img src="https://kretschmerlea.github.io/Aufgabe02/thats70sshow1.jpg">
            <article>There are also other characters on the show. Important to mention are Red and Kitty, Erics parents and Bob, Donnas Dad. There are also other relatives on the show, but they only appear every now and then. Kitty is always showing her love what can be a little bit too much sometimes. Most of the time, she's all over the place.</article> 
            <h2>The circle</h2>
            <article>As you probably know most actors who play teenagers are older than their characters. Mostly they are already in their twenties. Mila Kunis although, who starred Jacky on the show, was only 14 years old, when the first episode ran. So she was actually almost 2 years younger than her character and much younger than her co-workers.</article>
            
    
            <img src="https://kretschmerlea.github.io/Aufgabe02/that70sshow.gif">
            <article>Most of the time they're sitting in Erics basement. They especially like to sit in the so called "circle". What are they doing? Well, defenitely smoking more than cigarettes.</article>
