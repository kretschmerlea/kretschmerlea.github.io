            <h2>What is "That '70s Show"</h2>
            <article>"That '70s Show" was an American TV show. It first aired on August 23, 1998. It was on TV till May 2006. Although it's basically a 90s/00s show, it's placed in the 70s hence the title.</article>

                    <h2>The circle</h2>
                    <article>As you probably know most actors who play teenagers are older than their characters. Mostly they are already in their twenties. Mila Kunis although, who starred Jacky on the show, was only 14 years old, when the first episode ran. So she was actually almost 2 years younger than her character and much younger than her co-workers.</article>

                    <article>Most of the time they're sitting in Erics basement. They especially like to sit in the so called "circle". What are they doing? Well, defenitely smoking more than cigarettes.</article>
                    <article>In general they are always at Eric's house. That's why his parents also have big roles on the show. Red is always treating Eric a little harsh, but in reality he loves his son. Kitty is always showing her love what can be a little bit too much sometimes. Most of the time, she's all over the place.</article>
